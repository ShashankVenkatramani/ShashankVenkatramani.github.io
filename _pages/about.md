Currently building @ Align Glasses

Prev. at Autonomous Vehicle Laboratory @ UC San Diego, Amazon, General Atomics

Expertise in Machine Learning, Systems Design, AWS

Can become a novice in just about anything else tech stack related with enough time (except quantum computing... those papers are a hardread...)

I love to learn and play with things - if you are building or researching something cool that you want to share, shoot me an email!!
